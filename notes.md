## Later priority

## Todo's
1. responsive navbar (links space between --> see bugs) (DONE)
2. manifest.json (TO CHECK IF NECESSARY)
3. Change images homepage and such 
4. Feature: change language(NL/EN)
5. Product page (with content.json to auto create page)
6. Product detail page
7. cart and 'shop' functionality
8. check css background image (login) -- it's not there, is it necessary
9. succes messages (when adding to cart, when registering, when resetting password)

## Known bugs
1. Is screen-size less then 620 scroll functionality is broken
        meaning: you can't scroll
2. Can not get the navigation items spaced (with flex)
3. http://localhost:3000/login?name=&mail=&userName=&password=&password= 
        (routing issue! --> gebeurt op submit van registreer formulier)
4. You can scroll sideways.. 
        go to home, make screen 'mobile' and you can scroll to the side

## Late priority:
1. Responsive productpage (see change on flex if screen is wider then 1200px)
   Can we make this prettier? 
2. border radius on small screen
3. suggestion: homepage has 6 tiles now, render for when screen is small enough to display them pretty
